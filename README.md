The official resource tracking the rise of reliable, autonomous, and agentic systems powering the next generation of AI-native software.

## About

**Reliable Agents** is a public resource and ecosystem map documenting the frameworks, benchmarks, and breakthroughs shaping the agentic future — from browser-capable systems to self-improving reasoning models.

It was created by **Alex Nevedovsky** and **Brian Kennish**, founders and operators obsessed with one question:

> “Which agents can we actually trust to work — every time?”

The project began as part of the **[No Cap](https://nocap.so)** initiative to identify, test, and benchmark the world’s most consistent AI agents — and has since expanded into a shared knowledge base for builders, researchers, and investors navigating the agentic stack.

## What’s Inside

The resource currently catalogs and analyzes:

- Agent frameworks and SDKs (e.g. CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph)
- Reliable browsing / automation stacks (e.g. Browserbase, Stagehand, Claude Computer Use)
- Benchmark datasets and evaluation methodologies
- Performance and reproducibility metrics across use cases
- Verified public tests and community submissions

---

## Key Metrics Tracked

For each agent or system, we highlight:

- **Reliability Score** – consistent task success rate across runs  
- **Reproducibility** – ability to yield identical outcomes under identical prompts  
- **Autonomy Depth** – degree of self-planning and multi-step execution  
- **Browser Competence** – capability in real-world web tasks  
- **Integration Stack** – model, framework, and runtime details  
- **Last Verified Date** – to ensure freshness and trust
